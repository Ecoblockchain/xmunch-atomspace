================

**XA** allows the dynamic construction of [semantic networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network) for [Knowledge Representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) in an abstract space of atoms (vertices and edges). It intends to be a tool for helping in [narrow AI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI), but also to be used in the implementation of [cognitive architectures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_architecture) for the Artificial General Intelligence ([AGI](http://www.agi-society.org/)) community. Even though it is inspired by the [OpenCog AtomSpace](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomspace) it is a different project with different conceptual notions and a completely independent architecture.
